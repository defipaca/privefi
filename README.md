## üìã Accelerator Application Submission Guide

This GitHub repository serves as the official submission for our project's accelerator application and contains the complete and original source code for assessment.

### Technical Design Explanation
This `README.md` file is structured to comprehensively explain the technical design of our code. We have detailed the core components, their interactions, system architecture, and implementation approach throughout this document.

### System Design Diagrams and Narrative
Our system design is explained through detailed narrative descriptions in the sections above, including:
- **Architecture Overview**: Frontend React application with Web3 integration
- **Component Structure**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Data Flow**: User interactions ‚Üí Web3 wallet ‚Üí Smart contracts ‚Üí Blockchain
- **Integration Points**: Wagmi/Viem for Ethereum, AI services for risk assessment

### Code Organization
Our codebase follows a clean, modular architecture:
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/          # React components (Navigation, Hero, Vaults, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/           # External service integrations (AI, blockchain)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/             # Configuration files (Wagmi, environment)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/              # Utility functions and helpers
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tsx           # Application entry point
```
Each component focuses on a single responsibility, with clear imports/exports and proper separation of concerns.

### Libraries and Frameworks Used
A comprehensive list of all libraries and frameworks can be found in `package.json`. Key technologies include:
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
