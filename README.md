## 📋 Accelerator Application Submission Guide

This GitHub repository serves as the official submission for our project's accelerator application and contains the complete and original source code for assessment.

### Technical Design Explanation
This `README.md` file is structured to comprehensively explain the technical design of our code. We have detailed the core components, their interactions, system architecture, and implementation approach throughout this document.

### System Design Diagrams and Narrative
Our system design is explained through detailed narrative descriptions in the sections above, including:
- **Architecture Overview**: Frontend React application with Web3 integration
- **Component Structure**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Data Flow**: User interactions → Web3 wallet → Smart contracts → Blockchain
- **Integration Points**: Wagmi/Viem for Ethereum, AI services for risk assessment

### Code Organization
Our codebase follows a clean, modular architecture:
```
src/
├── components/          # React components (Navigation, Hero, Vaults, etc.)
├── services/           # External service integrations (AI, blockchain)
├── config/             # Configuration files (Wagmi, environment)
├── utils/              # Utility functions and helpers
└── main.tsx           # Application entry point
```
Each component focuses on a single responsibility, with clear imports/exports and proper separation of concerns.

### Libraries and Frameworks Used
A comprehensive list of all libraries and frameworks can be found in `package.json`. Key technologies include:
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Web3**: Wagmi v2.16.0, Viem v2.33.0 for Ethereum integration
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query v5.83.0
- **Icons**: Lucide React v0.344.0
- **Development**: ESLint, TypeScript ESLint, Autoprefixer

### Points of XRPL Integration
Our blockchain integration points are implemented in:
- **`src/config/wagmi.ts`**: Web3 wallet connectivity and chain configuration
- **`src/components/WalletConnectButton.tsx`**: Wallet connection interface
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Prepared for vault subscription and yield distribution
- **Transaction Handling**: Ready for on-chain asset verification and reporting

*Note: While currently configured for Ethereum networks (mainnet, Sepolia, Goerli), the architecture is designed to easily integrate with XRPL through similar Web3 patterns.*

- This repository will be shared and accessed **only** by the XRPL Grants review team
- Your data and information will not be shared with any third parties without prior explicit consent
